2.	Write a shell script program for different arithmetic functions.

# Function to perform addition
addition() {
    sum=$(($1 + $2))
    echo "Sum of $1 and $2 is: $sum"
}

# Function to perform subtraction
subtraction() {
    diff=$(($1 - $2))
    echo "Difference of $1 and $2 is: $diff"
}

# Function to perform multiplication
multiplication() {
    product=$(($1 * $2))
    echo "Product of $1 and $2 is: $product"
}

# Function to perform division
division() {
    if [ $2 -ne 0 ]; then
        quotient=$(($1 / $2))
        echo "Quotient of $1 divided by $2 is: $quotient"
    else
        echo "Error: Division by zero is not allowed"
    fi
}

# Main script
num1=10
num2=5

addition $num1 $num2
subtraction $num1 $num2
multiplication $num1 $num2
division $num1 $num2
